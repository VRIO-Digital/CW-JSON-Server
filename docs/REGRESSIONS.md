# REGRESSIONS.md

Every bug that cost real debugging time, and the guard that stops it recurring.

Read this before touching the mock server, antd props, spacing, or a store
selector. Append to it whenever you fix something — see
`.claude/skills/contextweave-flow/SKILL.md`, phase 4.

**Template**

```
## <short title>
**Symptom** — what was visibly wrong.
**Root cause** — why, one sentence.
**Fix** — what changed.
**Guard** — mechanical (build fails) > diagnostic (message names the fix) > documented.
```

Guards are ranked: prefer one that fails the build. A note in a doc is the
weakest form and only acceptable when the first two do not apply.

## Stale mock server serves the old row shape

**Symptom** — Sources table showed 9 rows with a blank `source_id`,
`Invalid Date`, and `undefined table(s) · undefined col(s)`. Looked like a
frontend bug; cost two rounds of confusion.

**Root cause** — the running server had loaded `db.json` and the row-shaping code
at startup, before both changed. It kept answering with the old fields
(`name`, `last_sync`) while the new UI asked for `source_id`, `connected_at`,
`profiled_tables`.

**Fix** — killed the stale process and restarted it.

**Guard** — *diagnostic*: `listSources` in `src/api/client.ts` checks for rows
without a string `source_id` and throws a message naming the fix ("Restart it:
stop `npm run mock` and start it again") **before** the schema runs, so the user
gets one actionable sentence instead of a wall of field mismatches.

**Rule** — editing `server.mjs` or `db.json`'s shape requires a restart, and a
restart clears every registered source. When output looks impossibly wrong,
check the server's age before your own code.

---

## Background server holds the port but stops answering

**Symptom** — `curl localhost:4000` timed out, yet a new `npm run mock` failed
with `EADDRINUSE`. Happened three times.

**Root cause** — a server started with `nohup … &` from a shell that then exited.
On Windows the child survives, keeps the listening socket, and accumulates
sockets in `CloseWait` while no longer serving.

**Fix** — `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 4000` to find the pid, `Stop-Process`,
restart under a supervisor that outlives the shell.

**Guard** — *diagnostic*: `server.mjs` has an `EADDRINUSE` handler that prints
how to check `/health`, how to find and kill the holder on Windows and macOS, and
how to run on another port — instead of an unhandled `error` event stack trace
that buries the cause. Also a `SIGINT` handler so Ctrl-C closes the listener
cleanly rather than orphaning it.

## PowerShell corrupted UTF-8 in a source file

**Symptom** — em dashes and `·` in `src/data/dummy.ts` turned into `â€"` and
`Â·`, plus a stray BOM.

**Root cause** — `Get-Content`/`Set-Content` round-trip in PS 5.1: the file was
read as ANSI (Windows-1252) because it had no BOM, then written back as UTF-8.

**Fix** — repaired the mojibake sequences and stripped the BOM with node reading
and writing explicit `'utf8'`, then scanned the whole tree to confirm nothing
else was affected.

**Guard** — *documented* (in `CLAUDE.md` gotchas): never round-trip a source file
through PowerShell text cmdlets. Use the Edit tool, or node with explicit
`'utf8'`. No mechanical guard exists because the corruption is only detectable
by scanning for known mojibake sequences after the fact.

---

## `erasableSyntaxOnly` rejects constructor parameter properties

**Symptom** — `error TS1294: This syntax is not allowed when
'erasableSyntaxOnly' is enabled` on `ApiError`.

**Root cause** — `constructor(message: string, readonly status: number)` is a
TypeScript-only construct; the tsconfig forbids syntax that cannot be erased.

**Fix** — declared `status: number` as a field and assigned it in the body.

**Guard** — *mechanical*: `tsc -b` in `npm run build` already fails on it. The
lesson is to build, not just lint — `oxlint` passes this happily.

---

## Unused import fails the build, not just lint

**Symptom** — build broke with `TS6133: 'Empty' is declared but its value is
never read` after a refactor removed its last use.

**Root cause** — `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` are on.

**Fix** — removed the dead imports.

**Guard** — *mechanical*: `npm run build` catches it. Never conclude a refactor
on `npm run lint` alone; lint reports these as warnings and exits 0.

---

## antd v6 prop renames

**Symptom** — deprecation diagnostics, then wrong rendering, on `Tag bordered`,
`Alert message`, `Drawer width`, `Modal destroyOnClose`.

**Root cause** — assumed antd v5's API. This project is on v6, which renamed
them: `bordered` → `variant`, `message` → `title`, `width` → `size` (Drawer),
`destroyOnClose` → `destroyOnHidden`.

**Fix** — read the installed `.d.ts` for each component and used the current
props.

**Guard** — *documented* (`CLAUDE.md` UI conventions) plus a habit: before using
an antd prop, `grep` the installed
`node_modules/antd/es/<component>/*.d.ts` for `deprecated`. Cheaper than a
render-and-look cycle.

---

## `?? []` in a selector defeats memoisation

**Symptom** — `oxlint` warned "React hook useMemo depends on `sources`, which
changes every render".

**Root cause** — `data?.sources ?? []` allocates a fresh array on every render,
so every downstream `useMemo` recomputed.

**Fix** — a module-level constant, exposed as `selectSources` in
`src/store/sourcesStore.ts`.

**Guard** — *mechanical*: `oxlint`'s `exhaustive-deps` catches it when the value
feeds a hook. **Rule** — selectors must return stable references; never inline a
fallback literal in one.

---

## Global find-replace renamed a prop it should not have

**Symptom** — `Cannot find name 'load'` in `ChangeSignalsTab`, which takes a
`reload` prop.

**Root cause** — a blanket `void reload()` → `void load()` replacement across a
file hit a prop of the same name in an unrelated component.

**Fix** — restored the prop call site.

**Guard** — *documented*: use the Edit tool with surrounding context for
identifier renames. A whole-file string replace has no scope awareness. When one
is unavoidable, build immediately and read every error rather than assuming it
was clean.

---

## antd Modal bodies cannot be asserted on

**Symptom** — an SSR smoke test of `ConnectSourceModal` returned a zero-length
string, so nothing could be verified.

**Root cause** — `Modal` and `Drawer` render through a React portal, and
`renderToString` does not traverse portals.

**Fix** — split the flow into `ConnectSourceWizard` (assertable) wrapped by
`ConnectSourceModal` (dialog chrome only).

**Guard** — *documented* (`CLAUDE.md` commands): keep dialog content in its own
component. Better structure anyway — the separation is why the wizard is
testable.

---

## Profiled counts contradicted their own semantics

**Symptom** — the catalogue showed real table and column counts for a freshly
registered source, while the UI copy said counts "stay 0 until the Metadata
Profiler has run".

**Root cause** — catalogue rows were populated from `db.json`'s table data at
registration time, which conflated registering with profiling.

**Fix** — connected rows report `profiled_tables`/`profiled_columns` (0 until a
job runs) and `quality: null`.

**Guard** — *documented* (`CLAUDE.md`): registration is instant, profiling is a
separate async event. Do not "fix" a zero by reading it out of `db.json`.

---

## Test assertion was wrong, not the code

**Symptom** — a suite reported `1 FAILURES` on `validateDb`, and separately
`20 FAILURES` on the sources API.

**Root cause** — both were the harness's fault. The first asserted 7 problems
where 8 was correct (7 missing keys **plus** one wrong shape). The second ran
against a stale server on port 4000.

**Fix** — corrected the assertion; re-ran the second suite on a spare port.

**Guard** — *documented*: when a suite fails, check the assertion and the
environment before changing the code. Report which it was — a fixed test that
was never broken hides a real defect.

---

## A stale server's old shape read as a schema bug

**Symptom** — saving in the New Graph wizard failed with `use_case.personas
should be an array, got undefined; use_case.kpis …; (+3 more)` — seven fields
undefined at once. The message points at the schema, so the hunt starts in
`client.ts` and `savedUseCase`, both of which were correct.

**Root cause** — the mock server process had been started before the commit that
added the step 2–7 fields, and `db.json` is read once at startup: the file on
disk was current, the process answering was not. `GET /graph-use-cases` returned
only the eight original keys.

**Fix** — restart `npm run mock`. No code was wrong.

**The worse half.** Every save also wrote that stale document back, so
`db.json` silently lost `graph_personas`, `graph_kpis`, `graph_hero_questions`
and `graph_answer_formats` — four keys no route the user touched had anything to
do with. `commitDb`'s `validateDb` is exactly the guard against this, and it
works going forward; it could not fire here because the running process predated
the keys and so did its copy of the required list. `npm run check-docs` caught
the loss, and the keys were restored from `git show HEAD:mock-server/db.json`.
**A stale server is a data-loss bug, not just a display bug** — kill it before
saving anything else.

Restarting onto the damaged file then failed a second way: the new process
booted fine and only broke inside a route (`Cannot read properties of undefined
(reading 'map')` from `/graph-personas/suggest`), because nothing validated the
document at startup.

**Second guard** — *mechanical* (`server.mjs`, before `server.listen`):
`validateDb(db)` runs at startup and the server **refuses to boot** on a
document the routes cannot serve, listing the missing keys and the restore
command. A write was already guarded; a boot was not.

**Guard** — *diagnostic* (`assertCurrentUseCaseShape` in `client.ts`): when a use
case carries **none** of the seven newer fields, the client throws
"…predates steps 2–7 … restart it: npm run mock" instead of listing the fields.
It fires on both `listUseCases` and `saveUseCase`. The check must live in the
client — a server running old code cannot warn that it is running old code. It
only triggers when *every* newer field is absent, so a genuine one-field bug
still gets the field name rather than being blamed on the server's age.

---

## A stale server dropped a *nested* key nobody was guarding

**Symptom** — the `graph_studio.canvas` seed vanished from `db.json` minutes
after it was written. `validateDb` passed, the server started fine, and only the
missing tab gave it away.

**Root cause** — the same stale-process write-back as before, one level deeper.
`commitDb` writes the whole in-memory document, and a process started before
`canvas` existed carries a `graph_studio` without it. `DB_SHAPE.graph_studio`
only checked `review_items`, `generated` and `pivot`, so the write validated and
the key was lost silently.

**Fix** — re-seeded from the edit, and killed the process before it could do it
again.

**Guard** — *mechanical* (`DB_SHAPE.graph_studio` in `server.mjs`): the check now
requires `canvas.nodes` and `canvas.edges` too, so that write is refused with a
message naming the key. **A top-level-only shape check cannot see nested loss** —
when a seeded section grows a sub-object the app depends on, add it to the shape
check at the same time, or the next stale server deletes it for free.

## "published v16" named a version nobody had seen

**Symptom** — the Graph Studio list showed `published v16` on a graph whose
publish had produced **v15**. The number on screen matched nothing in the
Versions table.

**Root cause** — one field doing two jobs. `version` was `15 + publishedCount`,
so it meant "the working draft", while `state` flipped to `published` after the
first publish. Rendered as one tag, `{state} {version}` read as a claim about
v16 — which is the *next* draft, not anything live.

**Fix** — the summary now returns `version` (the working draft) **and**
`last_published_version` (what is live, or null). The card and the header show
`draft v16` beside `live v15`.

**Guard** — *mechanical* (`client.ts` schema + a rendered assertion): the API
carries both fields, and the smoke test asserts the pair after a publish —
`version` is v16, `last_published_version` is v15, and the string
`published v16` never appears. **Rule** — a draft version and a live version are
two facts; one tag rendering both is how they get confused.

---

## Fourteen endpoints had no schema, all of them writes

**Symptom** — none yet, which is the point: `CLAUDE.md` promised "add a schema
whenever you add an endpoint", and an audit found fourteen exported fetchers
returning payloads straight to the UI with no boundary check —
`oauthStart`, both registrations, the generic one, `disconnectSource`,
`deleteSource`, both allowlist updates, `listProjectDatasets`, both `profile*`
calls, both `PATCH` note savers, `cancelProfilingJob`, `deleteUseCase` and both
`/db` writes.

**Root cause** — the rule was read as being about *reads*. Every one of the gaps
was a write, whose result is rendered or stored just the same: a registered
source goes into a table, a queued job goes onto the jobs board and is polled, a
saved section re-renders the editor.

**Fix** — schemas for all of them, reusing `SOURCE_ROW` and `JOB` where the shape
already existed.

**Guard** — *mechanical* (`scripts/check-docs.mjs`): an exported fetcher that
calls `request()` must also reach `validate()`, directly or via a helper that
does. Verified by stripping one fetcher's schema and watching `check-docs` name
it. **A doc line could not hold this** — it had already failed to, fourteen times.

**Also learned** — `nullable()` permits an absent key, not just `null`, so a
nullable field's schema checks its type rather than its presence. Where the key
must exist, do not make it nullable.

---

## check-docs reported "0 of 0 connectors available" on Windows

**Symptom** — `npm run preflight` failed on `at least one connector is usable:
0 of 0 available`, with `connectors.ts` untouched and both real connectors
plainly `available: true`. Every per-connector claim silently passed too, because
the loop it fed had nothing to iterate.

**Root cause** — `scripts/check-docs.mjs` split the file on `/\n {2}\{\n/`. Git
checks these files out with CRLF on Windows, so the text is `\r\n  {\r\n` and the
trailing `{\n` never matched. The parse returned zero connector blocks, and a
check with nothing to check reported the code as broken.

**Fix** — `/\r?\n {2}\{\r?\n/`. Twelve claims came back (38 → 50 verified).

**Guard** — *mechanical*: the fix is the guard, and the check now proves itself —
a zero-length parse can no longer masquerade as a passing sweep. **Rule for any
new assertion in `check-docs.mjs`: match `\r?\n`, never a bare `\n`.** A doc-gate
that fails for a reason unrelated to the docs trains everyone to ignore it, which
is worse than not having it.

---

## A deleted button left a prop that broke the build

**Symptom** — `npm run build` failed on two `TS6133` errors that had nothing to do
with the change in hand: `onStartNew` unused in `NewGraphPage.tsx`, `BuildOutlined`
unused in `nav.ts`. `npm run lint` reported both as *warnings*, so a lint-only
check looked clean.

**Root cause** — the "Start a use case" button was removed from the empty saved-use-cases
panel but its prop, its handler and the call site stayed; `BuildOutlined` was left
behind when two nav entries were commented out. `noUnusedLocals` is on, so both
are errors to `tsc` and warnings to oxlint.

**Fix** — restored the button the panel's own comment promises ("offer the one
thing that fills it"), and dropped the unused icon import, naming it in the
commented-out entries so it comes back with them.

**Guard** — *mechanical*, and it already existed: `tsc` fails on both. The lesson
is about which gate to trust — **oxlint warnings do not fail the build and `tsc`
does, so never conclude a refactor on `npm run lint` alone.** `npm run preflight`
runs both; that is the only signal that counts.
